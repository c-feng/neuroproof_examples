This is a 250x250x250 cube from the distal Drosophila medulla with isotropic
resolution of 10nm.  This small volume was used since it seemed to possess a
nice blend of easy and hard to segment regions.  This dataset contains a
'grayscale_maps' directory for the data stack.  It also contains
a ground truth volume, label volume, and boundary prediction file corresponding
to this data stack.  The results directory contains
two classifiers generated using the commands outlined in the main README.
