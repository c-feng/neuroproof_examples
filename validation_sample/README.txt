This sample is a 520x520x520 volume from the Drosophila
medulla at 10nm isotropic pixel resolution.  This directory
contains the original grayscale_maps, an h5 file corresponding
to the initial over-segmentation (watershed) of the grayscale
data, an h5 file corresponding the groundtruth for this stack,
and results directory for running both prediction and analysis
algorithms on the example.  The boundary prediction file is too
large for inclusion in this directory but can be computed
via running Gala per the instruction in the top-level README.
