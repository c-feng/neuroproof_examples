This is a 250x250x250 cube from the distal Drosophila medulla with isotropic
resolution of 10nm.  This dataset contains a 'grayscale_maps' directory where
the original stack is and a results directory which contains a boundary prediction
'ilp' file produced from running ilastik.  This boundary prediction can then
be applied to the other samples as a way to produce a watershed.
